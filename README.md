# Planet Simulation

This is a 2D gravity-based simulation where planets interact through Newtonian physics. Planets can orbit, collide, merge, and be manipulated in real time by the user.

## Controls

### Mouse
- **Left Click**: Add a new planet at the cursor location.
- **Shift + Click**: Select a planet.

### Keyboard
- **Space**: Pause or resume the simulation.
- **Shift + A**: Select all planets.
- **Delete**: Remove selected planet(s).
- **+ / =**: Zoom in.
- **-**: Zoom out.
- **↑ ↓ → ←**: Move selected planets or screen
- **< >**: Speed up/Slow down

## Features

- Realistic orbital motion based on gravitational attraction.
- Planet collisions and optional merging behavior.
- Zoom functionality to explore different regions of the simulation.
- Interactive selection and deletion of planets.
- Pause the simulation to inspect or modify the system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the simulation.

## Future Improvements

- Adjustable planet properties (mass, velocity, radius).
- Trail rendering to visualize orbits.
- Save/load simulation state.
- UI panel for adding and editing objects.
